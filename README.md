# Supplementary material
Python Simulation Code for the article *Integrative modelling of pathogen spread through animal trade by accounting for farmersâ€™ control decisions* by Cristancho-Fajardo, Ezanno, Vergu.

- The Epi_decision_function.py script gathers the main functions used in the generatation od the simulated data presented in the article.
- The fixed_parameters folder contains the fixed simulation setting, network structure and demographic parameters. As well as a notebook on their generation.
- The Vignette.ipynb is a jupyter-notebook in which after model's parameters are initially established, a run of the integrative model is simulated, and plots display the epidemic and decision dynamcics.
