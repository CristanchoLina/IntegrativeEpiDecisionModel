# Supplementary material for the article *Integrative modelling of pathogen spread through animal trade by accounting for farmers’ control decisions* by Cristancho-Fajardo, Ezanno, Vergu.
Python Simulation Code 

- The Epi_decision_function.py script gathers the main functions used in the generatation of the simulated epidemic and decision data presented in the article.
- The fixed_parameters folder contains the fixed simulation setting, fixed network structure and fixed demographic parameters. As well as the notebook on their generation. 
- The Vignette.ipynb is a jupyter-notebook in which after the model's parameters are initially established, a run of the integrative model is simulated, and plots display the epidemic and decision dynamcics.
